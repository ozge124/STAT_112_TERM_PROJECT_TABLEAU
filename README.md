**Project Overview**

This term project investigates how fundamental data processing and visualization techniques can be utilised to an e-commerce transactions dataset to examine and get detailed insights into customner demographics, purchasing behavior, product preferences, and engagement metrics. The overall aim is to create insightful visualizations and interpret the provided data using Tableau and apply the statistical skills taught in STAT112 course.

**The project follows a structured, step-by-step 5 core analytical processes:**
1) Understanding the dataset and defining research questions
2) Cleaning, transforming and verifying the data if necessary
3) Applying statistical analyises (e.g. identfying dominant categories, checking quantitative relationship)
4) Using Tableau to create interpretable, meaningful visualizations and design interactive dashboard that summarizes key inferences about customer behavior
5) Producing a clear report that includes methods used, visualizations and interpretations of these results

**Key Research Questions**

This project includes eight targeted data visualizations, which are created to answer a specific research question.

**1.** In each city, which product categories are purchased most frequently, and how do their average delivery times compare?

**2.** How do discounts influence sales quantity trends over time?

**3.** How does the average discount amount differ between Loyal Customers and One-Time Buyers across different age groups?

**4.** Does session length actually predict higher spending?

**5.** How Gender and Device Usage Influence Customer Count Across Different Age Groups?

**6.** How Does Customers' Average Session Duration Vary Across Different Product Categories?

**7.** How does the gender distribution of customers change in each product category?

**8.** How does customer age vary among payment methods?
